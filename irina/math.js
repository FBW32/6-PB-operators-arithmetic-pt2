// Basic Arithmetic Problems

// Q1. In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars. Each ticket costs 15 dollars. How many tickets were sold?
let sells = 6450;
let ticket = 15;
console.log(sells / ticket); // 430

// Q2. Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?
let income = 500;
let months = 12;
console.log(500 * 12);

// Percentage

// Q3. Calculate the percentage of 17/30. Expected output: number%
let num = 17/30;
let per = 100;
console.log(num*per);  // 56.666666666666664%

// Geometry Formulas

// Q4. Calculate the perimeter of a square. Assume each side is 4.75cm.
let side = 4.75;
console.log(4 * side); // 19

// Q5. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.
let perimeter = 5 + 6 + 7;
console.log(perimeter); // 18

// Q6. Calculate the area of a square. Each side is 5cm.
let sides = 5;
console.log(sides**2); // 25
